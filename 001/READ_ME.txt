You will first notice that there are 2 separate files for the validator. 'chess_validator.rb' and 'chess_validator2.rb'. Same goes for the test. The original file was done with the help of a 'higher power'. Part 2 was done completely by myself, and, as you can see, was purely janitorial in purpose. I tried to emulate the logic from the original file, but it was a little over my head. I would have done more refactoring if not for the lack of time. Looking forward to hearing more comments.
